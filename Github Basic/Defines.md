## Git
```Git``` is a free and open source distributed ```version control system (VCS)``` designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

```Git``` is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.


<a name="docker"></a>
## Docker
```Docker``` is a set of ```platform as a service (PaaS)``` products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

#### Docker Components
The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:
- Software
- Objects
- Registries

#### Docker Tools
- Docker Compose
- Docker Swarm

## Automated Testing
**Automated tests** is more than just a luxury for any agile software development team. It is a need, and is an essential tool to find bugs quickly during early phases of software development cycles. When there is a new feature that is still in development phase, developers can run automated tests and see how other parts of the system are affected by those changes.

## Continuous Integration
**Continuous Integration** is the idea that as different members of the team work on code on different git branches, the code is merged to a single working branch which is then built and tested with automated workflows. This helps to constantly make sure everyone's code is working properly together and is well-tested.
